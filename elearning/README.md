### Block Chain Fundamentals
We won't cover this material until later or never
* Hash Chain
* Forks
* Longest Chain
* Proof of Work

### RChain Abstractions
* RSpace
* Casper

### Rholang 1
* Send and Receive
* Quoting and unquoting with `@` and `*`
* `new` names
* Strings

### Rholang 2
* Pattern matching
* Bundles
* Data structures
* Recursion
* **Project:** Implement makeMint-style token

### Rholang 3
* Advanced pattern matching
* **Project:** Implement merge sort or some other similarly interesting algorithm

### RNode Basics
* Install and run RNode
* Use thin clients
* deploy and propose blocks

### Validating
* Genesis Ceremony Theory
* Practice of bootstrapping own network
* Key management best practices
* Ecomonics

### Casper 1
* Proof of Stake and wagering to play
* Validator weights
* Justifications
* Fork choice rule
* Equivocations

### Casper 2
* Abstract CBC Casper
* **Project:** implement casper over some game (eg. chess)

### Sharding
* n times shards, n times throughput
* RChain's tree model
* Depository / Mint
* Ethereum's attempts
* Multi-parent model
* Old Lattice model / namespaces

### Dapps 1
* Nth caller example
* Using RChain-API and RSign
* Name registry
* **Project:** Build a mineable coin like 0xbitcoin

### Dapps 2
* Cost model
* Phlogiston dimensions
* **Project:** Make your own REV:alt order book.


### #Mobile Process Calculi 1
